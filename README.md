# Fake News Prediction Model in Machine Learning

## This repository contains a fake news prediction model built using Logistic Regression, a classical machine learning algorithm. This project aims to provide a simple and effective tool for identifying fake news articles based on a given dataset of labelled news articles. 1 indicates FAKE news whereas 0 indicates Real news.
## Steps:-
1)Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing: Obtain a suitable dataset containing labelled news articles, where each article is classified as either fake or real. Preprocess the data to clean and vectorize the text data for use in the Logistic Regression model.

2)Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its Root word.

3)Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data to represent each news article numerically. Commonly used techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

4)Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

5)Model Training: Train the Logistic Regression model on the training data with the extracted features. During training, the model will learn to distinguish between fake and real news articles.

6)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using various metrics such as accuracy.
